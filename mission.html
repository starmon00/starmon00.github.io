    <h1>Mission Statement</h1>

    <p>
        Not Black Market Gaming was created in order to help the poor children who struggle with their parents in order to buy the latest and hottest games. We understand this because our Founders went through the exact same thing. We are here to end that suffering and allow children to purchase video games with just their lunch money. Thatâ€™s right! By just skipping one lunch in school, they will be able to afford the highest rating games so they no longer have to embarrass their parents and have to cry in front of the customers while at the game store.
